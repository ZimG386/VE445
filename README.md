# Alzhermer MRI Diagnosis and Reproduction with CNN and GAN

This is a project that aims to compare multiple classification methods including KNN and CNN network in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, reach higher accuracy with only single-angled MRI dataset and use GAN network to reconstruct brain MRI photos of Alzheimer’s disease patients, which are possible to then be fed back to the classification network to test its result.  

Our dataset comes from [Kaggle-Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset). Methodologies include **Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN and GAN**. It turns out our neural network can at least reach **98%** accuracy in early Alzheimer detection. Detailed codes can be found in the .ipynb files or VE445_Final_Project_Gong_Li_Wang_Code.pdf. For the report, please refer to VE445_Final_Project_Gong_Li_Wang.pdf. 

The project last from Nov 2022 to Dec 2022 and served as a course project for SJTU-JI VE445-Intro to Machine Learning. Team members include Zimu Gong, Yifan Li and Ming Wang.
